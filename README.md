# COVID

Our objective is to identify variables that can predict *cases* and *death*. 

We pulled COVID outcomes from [here](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide). 

We pulled other variables from various sources: World Bank Data from 2018, and [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/roche-data-science-coalition/uncover).
